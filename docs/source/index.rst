   <a href="https://www.oxvalue.ai/" target="_blank">OxValueAI</a> 
   is a spin-out company from Oxford University. We utilize data and AI technology to evaluate the monetary value of technology or technology-rich startup companies to achieve our core goals of supporting innovation and SMEs and facilitating technology transfer to developing countries. Core to the OxValue.AI methodology is the VEST (Valuation of Early Stage Technology) Tool, which leverages a number of variables including patent data, developed within the Technology and Management Centre for Development (TMCD) at the Department for International Development of the University of Oxford. OxValue.AI engages unique cutting-edge technologies to determine the financial value of technology (before or post-patent award), delivering a game-changing approach which will provide an objective, accurate, affordable and accessible decision-making tool for both the investor and inventor communities.
